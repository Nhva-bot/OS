Week One [System Planning and Distribution Selection]

Objectives:
* Creating a system architecture diagram showing both system and network connections
* Provide a distribution selection justification comparing chosen server against alternatives
* Configuring the workstation according to project requirements
* Use the command-line interface (CLI) specific to the chosen system

The following below shows the two system architectures chosen as well as the server connected to the VM (Virtual Machine). One is Ubuntu Desktop and the other Fedora. The chosen server is Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ubuntu server.

(picture will add later)


Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI):
The reason for choosing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure apart from the others is that it provided the most suitable environment, which is free use of the server use throughout the duration of doing the coursework. Unlike AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, OCI would be ideal for OS behaviour testing and performance. As it is always free it would provide stable and consistent computing instances that do not expire given the consistent CPU, RAM and disk resources throughout the coursework. Furthermore the other servers required costs.

Workstations Configuration:
The chosen Linux workstations environments were run in a VirtualBox virtual machine. The chosen selection of Ubuntu Desktop and Fedora Workstation were chosen to provide clear comparison between the two different systems.

Ubuntu Desktop:
This was chosen because it is widely supported and is widely used. It is one of the most commonly used Linux systems for cloud computing and primary workstation. It is also compatibility with the server OS. Great use for running benchmarks and monitoring tools. Supports a full desktop environment and strong CLI support. I have chosen to go with this as it will let me see the stability compared to its counterpart Fedora. 

Key Trade-off:
* Stable
* Easier
* Not so strict on security

Fedora Workstation:
Fedora Workstation is cutting edge as it uses SELinux and enables this mode by default. It gives strong mandatory access control (MAC) and advanced security features which security has a distinct framework compared to Ubuntu. This will allow me to see the security.

Key Trade-off:
* Complex
* Secure
