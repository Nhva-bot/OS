Week One [System Planning and Distribution Selection] 

Objectives:
* Creating a system architecture diagram showing both system and network connections
* Provide a distribution selection justification comparing chosen server against alternatives
* Configuring the workstation according to project requirements
* Use the command-line interface (CLI) specific to the chosen system

Workstations Configuration:
The chosen Linux workstations environments were run in a VirtualBox virtual machine. The two systems we chose to look at was Ubuntu Desktop and Fedora Workstation were chosen to provide clear comparison between the two different systems.

Ubuntu Desktop:
This was chosen because it is widely supported and is widely used. It is one of the most commonly used Linux systems for cloud computing and primary workstation. It is also compatibility with the server. Great use for running benchmarks and monitoring tools. Supports a full desktop environment and strong CLI support. I have chosen to go with this as it will let me see the stability compared to its counterpart Fedora. 

Key Trade-off:
* Stable
* Easier
* Not so strict on security

Fedora Workstation:
Fedora Workstation is cutting edge as it uses SELinux and enables this mode by default. It gives strong mandatory access control (MAC) and advanced security features which security has a distinct framework compared to Ubuntu. 

Key Trade-off:
* Complex
* Secure

The following below shows the two system architectures chosen connected to the VM (Virtual Machine). One is Ubuntu Desktop and the other Ubuntu Server.

The following pictures show CLI as well as connection to the server. It also shows that we ping the server from the workstation. Futhermore we log into the server from the workstation. Futhermore I chose to go with Ubuntu as I was more familier with it than any other system.
