Week Seven (Security Audit)

* Conduct a security audit and evaluate overall system configuration

In order to understand how well the system is doing I will need to install Lynis. In doing this I can get a score of how well the system is. Then through that I can correct and improve anythinig that falls below that.

Above we can see that I install Lynis and I then run it to get a score of the system. As you can see below is the Hardeniing Index and a Warning.
