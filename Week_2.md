Week Two (Security Planning and Testing Methodology)

Objectives:
* Create a performance testing plan describing Remote Monitoring Methodology
* Security Configuration Checklist (SSH hardening, firewall configuration, MAC,  automatic updates, user privilege management, and network security)
* Threat Model identifying

OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) will carry out the performance test for the system remotely using SSh connections. All monitoring and testing will be performed through command line interface (CLI). The things that will focused on are as follow:
* Baseline Performance Testing
* Application Load Testing
* Bottleneck Identification
* Optimisation Testing

Remote Monitoring Methodology tools:
As we carrying this out remotely using SSH the following tools will be used:
* top/htop - CPU and memory usage
* vmstat - memory and process
* iostat - disk I/O performance
* free -h - memory usage
* ss - network connections
* iperf3 - network throughput and latency
* journalctl - system and service logs

Using the above tools will allow me
