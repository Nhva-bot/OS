Week Six (Performance Evaluation and Analysis)

* Execute detailed performance testing and analyse operating system behaviour under different workloads.

In this week we look at the performance following the testing plan we had made in the pervious week. We will apply our testing methodology on the applications we chose. To be able to see the information, we also made a script to show the performance of the system before loading any of the application. You can see it below.

The first test we run will look at the CPU performance testing. This will be done by using stress-ng to generate controlled processor load. During testing CPU utilisation and system load increased showing CPU workload behaviour. The results can be seen below.
